                food. Food has a culture. It has a history. It has a story. It has relationships.”</p>

            <p>It’s certainly not the first thing you think of when you hear “teenager’s Friday night.” I’d be lying if
                I said there weren’t moments when I second-guessed my decision. But then I saw the senior swaying along,
                clapping, grinning and even complimenting me. That made everything worth it.

                The point was to liven up their evening, but I almost feel as if I got the better end of the bargain!
